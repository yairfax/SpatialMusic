# Spatial Music
Spatial Music is an iOS app that uses Apple's motion tracking and 3D rendering APIs to play music in 3D space.

## Requirements
This app uses the motion tracking hardware in AirPods Pro, and won't work without them.  

It should be noted that this app is a work-in-progress. It doesn't support all the features you'd expect from a normal music player, including the ability to queue songs. It can also only play DRM-free songs, which means no music from Apple Music.  

This project was more intended as an exploration of iOS, motion tracking, and 3D rendering, both visual and aural.
